What you will learn:

Component-based development with Knockout.js.

How to use this sample:

1. Understand the problem that Knockout components solve.

2. In the code, look at Knockout.js component created in app.js, with its view in app.js.

3. Notice the usage of js/viewModels, an idea to prepare the way for Oracle JET.

4. In the index file, look at the usage of the "component" binding to load the Knockout component.

5. Realize that Oracle JET also has components, expressed in JQuery UI, which we will see later.
