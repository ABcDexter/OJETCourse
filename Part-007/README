What you will learn:

First usage of Oracle JET, instead of Require.js and Knockout.js separately.

Here, we use Bower to install Oracle JET. We could also use Yeoman
and we could also use the Oracle JET Support plugin in NetBeans IDE.

How to use this sample:

1. Remove Require.js and Knockout.js from bower.json.
2. Include dependency on "oraclejet": "latest" instead.
3. Compare the result to the previous example, the same libraries are there, plus more.
4. The application should work exactly as before.
5. Point out that we can also generate the app via Yeoman and via NetBeans IDE.
6. Show the different templates, e.g., QuickStart Basic and the hybrid mobile templates.
7. Talk a bit about NetBeans in this context.
